# Portfolio Website
This is the website I will use to showcase my work.
## Use
To add different images, add them to `images_src`, edit `Gruntfile.js` with desired width, then run the `grunt` command within the folder. Repeat for each width.
## Future improvements
* Add modals for each featured item to display additional information about each project
* Create better images for the featured items
* Experiment with overlaying a screen-effect pattern on the images in order to overcome the aliasing and loss of detail as the images scale
* Add additional featured items for native code projects I've worked on in a separate section titled "Native"
